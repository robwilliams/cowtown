      I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for 14 years. That's over 35,000 lessons! <br />
    You'll learn what the guitar really is, with straight talk, without the nonsense and self-promoting hype. <br />
    <br />
    You see, I focus completely on teaching - it's both my full-time job and my life's love. I'm not going to <br />
    to tell you how great a player I am, who I sound like, and other irrelevant stuff. My goal wasn't to become <br />
    a great player - it was to become an exceptional teacher, a very different path. <br />
    <br />
    Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals. Whether you want to learn <br />
    guitar or bass simply for the fun of it, or you want to know how it is that some players make it look effortless <br />
    while you're trying hard and getting nowhere - I can help. <br />
    <br />
    Give me a call and I'll be happy to talk you. Text me and I'll call you back - it's easier than ping-ponging texts <br />
    around. <br />
