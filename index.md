   <h2>Then...</h2> <h4>...the Conversation We're going to Have will be the Beginning of Your Path to Mastering Everything on Your Wish-List.

   <p><h4>
        Because, whether you want to learn guitar or bass just for the fun of it, or you want to become one of those rare players who sound fantastic <strong>AND</strong> make it look effortless (whilst everyone else is trying hard and getting nowhere), I'll get you there.</h4></p>

        <p>If You only get Ordinary tuition, you'll only get Ordinary results. But if You Want Unconventional Results, get an Unconventional teacher.</p>
        <h2><p>I don't do conventional, and I don't do Ordinary: Do You?</p></h2>
</h4></p>
<p><h4>Are You ready to change the way You think about music, Forever?</h4></p>
<p>   </p>


<h4>
<p>I'm a bit odd, unusual, and very Unconventional.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>

<p>In fact, the truth is that I'm sort-of a Mad Scientist, and I'm obsessed with solving the problem of making learning to play guitar easier, more logical and understandable, and above all else - fun! </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>It's what I love to do, so I do it as much as I can, and I only do it with people I like. </p>
<p>And you know what? </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>If you do something all day, every day, you get really, really good at it...</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>It's no great surprise, because, when You live and breathe what You do, You notice what works, what doesn't work quite so well, what helps and what hinders. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>And then you think about it, you refine it, you purify it and distill it all down to its essence: and You concentrate on just that One Thing that makes everything else follow, naturally...</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>You're not just going through the motions, let's just leave that to Ordinary People.</p>

   <em>
   <strong><font color="red">"... I've learned more in a few sessions with you than I did in the previous 13 years and 8 Grades."</font></strong>
   </em>  
    - Peter James.</h4> 
   </p>

<p><h3>Peter is a top bloke and a rapidly-improving rock and pop player, currently studying for his degree in an unrelated subject.</h3></p>
<p>      </p>
<p> </p>
<p><h4><strong><em> "...a long time ago, a young boy sneaked a peek into an old guitar case, and he fell in love for the first time..."</em></strong></h4>
</p>
<br/>

<p>
That's how it began for me, nearly forty years ago. I did what everyone said you had to do - I tried really hard, played for hours every day, learnt a new song every week or two - probably the same things that you have been told you have to do. I remember how hard it was, how sore my fingers got, and how frustrated I was. <p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Just like most students and players do,  I thought that was just the way it was, and if it was tough, then I was the problem - that there was something in me that was lacking.</p> 
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>I stuck with it for years, until I finally hit rock-bottom and decided to quit the usual path I was on and start over from zero. That turned out to be best thing that ever happened to me, because I began to search outside of the world of music and guitar for better answers to the problem of learning to play guitar. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>My breakthroughs started when I began to apply knowledge from outside of the world of music - from outside the fantasy world of rock 'n' roll. It was like lifting the lid on an unsolved mystery.   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>You see, the real problem is that we've all been lied to and suckered-in to a way of thinking that virtually guarantees we'll have a tough time learning to play. Even before we begin, most of us are doomed to accept difficulty and frustration, even though there is no reason to suffer. 
</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>    </p>
<p>That lie is like an ancient curse laid upon us by a malevolent sorceror, and I've been setting players free from that curse ever since I had a moment of clarity and insight that set me free from the curse. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals.</p>
<p>   </p>

<p>   </p>
<p>   I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for more than <strong>16 years</strong>. That's getting on for <strong>40,000 hours</strong> (Yes, you read it right - Forty Thousand hours) of guitar lessons and teaching experience as part of Shropshire Music Service, as a freelance peripatetic tutor and as a private tutor.

<p>   </p>
<p>   
   Whilst studying for my Music Diploma I developed a teaching system that uses and improves on the traditional methods which I had been using for 23 years, and it accelerated progress for students at every level. I had no choice but to create it, because I couldn't find what I needed anywhere - not in any of the hundreds of books, videos, magazines, or on the internet. What I developed has changed the lives of guitarists for over sixteen years, now, and it can change your life too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><h4><em><strong><font color="red">"... guitar tuition with you has been fantastic... You’ve really enabled me to succeed in playing songs I never, ever thought I’d be capable of playing." </font></strong></em>  John Cooper.</h4>
</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>
     I know that you'll want to deal with reality, and with principles that will remain true for all of your guitar-playing life - so that's what I will show you, all the way. From wherever you are - right now - to wherever you want to get to. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   
   And if you want to shake off the delusion of difficulty (who is daft enough to want to hold onto <em>that</em> weird belief), you're in the right place. 
 </p>
 <p>   </p>
 <p>   </p>
<p> 
  When we work together, you'll discover what the guitar really is - with straight talk. 
  </p>
  <p>   </p>
  <p>   </p>
<p><h3>I don't peddle  nonsense, or settle into dogmatically teaching conventional wisdom.</h3></p>
<p>I decline to be Cool or use self-promoting hype, or spout the conventional delusions of "Cool", "mojo" or "genius" to the people I help. What I do is give you a unique system that lays bare the way music works on the guitar.
</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>
  Teaching guitar, music and creativity is both my full-time job and my life's love - and I do it all day, every day, with great people. Now <strong>that's</strong> what I call cool.
</p>
<p>   </p>

<p>  </p>
<p>   </p>
 
  <p>I have both a First Class BA Honours degree in Music & Creative Writing and a Diploma in Music, so you can be certain that you're getting the real deal from a qualified professional. 
</p>
<p>As well as being an Accredited RGT (Registry of Guitar Teachers) Tutor, I'm also a certified Life Coach and Certified Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) Practitioner, so you can be sure of a flexible and sympathetic approach, using advanced techniques to accelerate your progress. </p>
