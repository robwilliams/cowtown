   I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for more than <strong>16 years</strong>. That's over <strong>34,000 hours</strong> (Yes, you read it right - Thirty-Four Thousand hours) of guitar lessons and teaching experience as part of Shropshire Music Service, as a freelance peripatetic tutor and as a private tutor.
   
   Whilst studying for my Music Diploma I developed a teaching system that uses and improves on the traditional methods I'd been using for 23 years, accelerating progress for students at every level. I had no choice but to create it, because I couldn't find what I needed anywhere - not in any of the hundreds of books, videos, magazines, or on the internet. What I developed has changed the lives of guitarists for over sixteen years, now, and it can change your life too.
   <p><em>"... guitar tuition with you has been fantastic... You’ve really enabled me to succeed in playing songs I never, ever thought I’d be capable of playing." </em>John Cooper.

   Ask yourself these simple questions: 
   <ul>
   <li>Do I want to find out how to play every song, in every key, in every style?</li>
   <li>Do I want to find out a faster way to learn to play?</li>
   <li>Do I want to play until my fingers bleed, or with ease and comfort?</li>
   <li>How can I get to play better, but in less time than everyone else?</li>
   <li>Do you want to play parrot-fashion, or understand what you do?</li>
   <li>Do you want to play without limits and liberate your mind?</li>
   <li>You deserve better than the "monkey-see, monkey-do" teaching that seems so commonplace, don't you?</li>
   
   </ul>
   
   </p>
   
   
   
   I know that you'll want to deal with reality, and with principles that will remain true for all of your guitar-playing life, so that's what I will show you, all the way: from wherever you are - right now - to wherever you want to get to. 
   
   And if you want to shake off the delusion of difficulty (who is daft enough to want <em>that?</em>) you're in the right place. 
  
  When we work together, you'll discover what the guitar really is - with straight talk. I don't peddle  nonsense and self-promoting hype, or spout the conventional delusions of "Cool", "mojo" or "genius". What I do is give you a unique system that lays bare the way music works on the guitar.

  Teaching guitar, music and creativity is both my full-time job and my life's love - and I do it all day, every day, with great people. How cool is that?

 
  I have both a First Class BA Honours degree in Music & Creative Writing and a Diploma in Music, so you can be certain that you're getting the real deal from a qualified professional. I'm also a certified Life Coach and a NLP Practitioner, so you can be sure of a flexible and sympathetic approach.

I am also fully DBS and CRB checked and cleared, so you have complete peace of mind.

Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals. Whether you want to learn guitar or bass just for the fun of it, or you want to know how it is that some players make it look effortless while you're trying hard and getting nowhere - I can help. 

Call me now, on 07968 077 280 or (01952) 882 928 and let's talk music!
