<h4>
<p>I'm a bit odd, unusual, Unconventional.</p>
<p>You could call me a Non-Conformist...   </p>
<p>   </p>

<p>In fact, the truth is that I'm obsessed with solving the problem of making learning to play guitar easier, more logical and understandable, and above all else - fun! </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>It's what I love to do, so I do it as much as I can, and I only do it with people I like. </p>
<p>And you know what? </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>If you do something all day, every day, you get really, really good at it...</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>It's no great surprise, because, when You live and breathe what You do, You notice what works, what doesn't work quite so well, what helps and what hinders. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>And then you think about it, you refine it, you purify it and distill it all down to its essence: and You concentrate on just that One Thing that makes everything else follow, naturally...</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>You're not just going through the motions, let's just leave that to Ordinary People.</p>

   </em>  
    - Tom Boddison.</h4> 
   </p>
   <p><h4>Tom is an excellent young player, fluent in a range of styles. It was a pleasure to move him up to a far higher level than when we began working together, releasing him from being stuck, maximising his abilities and helping him find more pleasure in his playing by changing his relationship with the instrument. I'm proud of you, Tom!</h4></p>

   <em>
   <strong><font color="blue">"... I've learned more in a few sessions with you than I did in the previous 13 years and 8 Grades."</font></strong>
   </em>  
    - Peter James.</h4> 
   </p>

<p><h3>Peter is a top bloke and a rapidly-improving rock and pop player, currently studying for his degree in an unrelated subject.</h3></p>
<p>      </p>
<p> </p>
<br>
<p><h3><strong><em><font color="green"> "...a long time ago, a young boy sneaked a peek into an old guitar case, and he fell in love for the first time..."</font></em></strong></h3>
</p>
<br>
<h4>
<p>
That's how it began for me, nearly forty years ago. I did what everyone said you had to do - I tried really hard, played for hours every day, learnt a new song every week or two - probably the same things that you have been told you have to do. I remember how hard it was, how sore my fingers got, and how frustrated I was. <p></h4>
<p>   </p>
<p>Just like most students and players do,  I thought that was just the way it was, and if it was tough, then I was the problem - that there was something in me that was lacking.</p> 
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>I stuck with it for years, until I finally hit rock-bottom and decided to quit the usual path I was on and start over from zero. That turned out to be best thing that ever happened to me, because I began to search outside of the world of music and guitar for better answers to the problem of learning to play guitar. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>My breakthroughs started when I began to apply knowledge from outside of the world of music - from outside the fantasy world of rock 'n' roll. It was like lifting the lid on an unsolved mystery.   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>You see, the real problem is that we've all been lied to and suckered-in to a way of thinking that virtually guarantees we'll have a tough time learning to play. Even before we begin, most of us are doomed to accept difficulty and frustration, even though there is no reason to suffer. 
</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>    </p>
<p>That lie is like an ancient curse laid upon us by a malevolent sorceror, and I've been setting players free from that curse ever since I had that moment of clarity and insight that set me free from the curse. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals.</p>
<p>   </p>

<p>   </p>
<p>   I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for more than <strong>16 years</strong>. That's getting on for <strong>40,000 hours</strong> (Yes, you read it right - Forty Thousand hours) of guitar lessons and teaching experience as part of the Shropshire Music Service, as a freelance peripatetic tutor and as a private tutor.

<p>   </p>
<p>   
   Out of my own frustration I developed a teaching system that uses and improves on the traditional methods which I had been using for 23 years, and it accelerated progress for students at every level. </p>
   <p>I had no choice but to create it, because I couldn't find what I needed anywhere - not in any of the hundreds of books, videos, magazines, or on the internet. What I developed has changed the lives of guitarists for over sixteen years, now, and it can change your life too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><h4><em><strong><font color="blue">"... guitar tuition with you has been fantastic... Youâ€™ve really enabled me to succeed in playing songs I never, ever thought Iâ€™d be capable of playing." </font></strong></em>  John Cooper.</h4>
</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>
     I know that you'll want to deal with reality, and with principles that will remain true for all of your guitar-playing life - so that's what I will show you, all the way. From wherever you are - right now - to wherever you want to get to. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>   
   And if you want to shake off the delusion of difficulty (who is daft enough to want to hold onto <em>that</em> weird belief), you're in the right place. 
 </p>
 <p>   </p>
 <p>   </p>
<p> 
  When we work together, you'll discover what the guitar really is - with straight talk. 
  </p>
  <p>   </p>
  <p>   </p>
<p><h3>I don't peddle  nonsense, or settle into dogmatically teaching conventional wisdom.</h3></p>
<p>I decline to be Cool or use self-promoting hype, or spout the conventional delusions of "Cool", "mojo" or "genius" to the people I help. What I do is give you a unique system that lays bare the way music works on the guitar.
</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>
  Teaching guitar, music and creativity is both my full-time job and my life's love - and I do it all day, every day, with great people. Now <strong>that's</strong> what I call cool.
</p>
<p>   </p>

<p>  </p>
<p>   </p>
 
  <p>I have both a First Class BA Honours degree in Music & Creative Writing and a Diploma in Music, so you can be certain that you're getting the real deal from a qualified professional. 
</p>
<p>As well as being an Accredited RGT (Registry of Guitar Teachers) Tutor, I'm also a certified Life Coach and Certified Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) Practitioner, so you can be sure of a flexible and sympathetic approach, using advanced techniques to accelerate your progress. </p>
