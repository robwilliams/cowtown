   I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for more than <strong>16 years</strong>. That's over <strong>34,000 hours</strong> (Yes, you read it right - Thirty-Four Thousand hours) of guitar lessons and teaching experience.
   
   Whilst studying for my Music Diploma I developed a teaching scheme that improves on traditional methods and accelerates progress for students at every level. I had no choice but to create it from the ground up because I couldn't find what I needed anywhere - not in my books, videos, magazines, or the internet: nowhere.
   
   If You - like me - deserve better than the "monkey-see, monkey-do" teaching that seems so commonplace, we'll get on just fine. 
  
  When we work together, you'll discover what the guitar really is - with straight talk. I don't peddle  nonsense and self-promoting hype, or spout the conventional delusions of "Cool", "mojo" or "genius". What I do is give you a unique system that lays bare the way music works on the guitar.

  Teaching guitar, music and creativity is both my full-time job and my life's love - and I do it all day, every day, with great people. How cool is that?

 

  I have both a First Class BA Honours degree in Music & Creative Writing and a Diploma in Music, so you can be certain that you're getting the real deal from a qualified professional. I'm also a certified Life Coach and a NLP Practitioner, so you can be sure of a flexible and sympathetic approach.

I am also fully DBS and CRB checked and cleared, so you have complete peace of mind.

Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals. Whether you want to learn guitar or bass just for the fun of it, or you want to know how it is that some players make it look effortless while you're trying hard and getting nowhere - I can help. 

Call me now, on 07968 077 280 or (01952) 882 928 and let's talk music!
