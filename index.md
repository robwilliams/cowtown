* CALL ME – and I’ll help you to PLAY AND HAVE FUN.
* CALL ME – if you are finding it tough going.
* CALL ME – if you want to supercharge your playing
* CALL ME – because life is too short to keep on learning the old-fashioned way.
* THINK ABOUT IT- spending years learning, OR learn now. It’s your choice.
* CALL ME - only if you want to learn how to play, how to do it, how it works and that it is really easy.

I realised that You need to play smarter not harder. Not to spend more of Your time learning, but to spend more time playing. Guitar lessons should be fun for both teacher and student.

I searched for a system that would show you what You wish You'd known on Day One. I searched everywhere, and found nothing like what You want - so i decided to build it myself, using everything I had ever learned, from every field i had ever worked in or read about.

You can learn faster and better because I’ve done all the hard stuff for you. I’ll show you how to "WORK THE SYSTEM" and how you can play almost any song in any key, in any style, with just a handful of proven "Tools" that build quickly into a system that will have you playing like your heroes – FAST.

 

I wanted results, but more importantly, i wanted to have FUN while i did it.

 After 20,000 plus sessions, patterns are obvious, and I have a unique way of bypassing problems and "blocks". I have a lot of fun, working with players as the lights go on and you "get the picture".

 That's what I do it for - so that you will not spend your time being frustrated, angry and ignorant.

 Nothing could be worse (well, not much worse!) than that feeling when you are trying to do what you want most to do. So, let's leave the myths and BS behind, have fun, learn fast and save your time.

 I have stolen some of the very best ideas from everything I have ever worked in or studied in order to be the best that I can be, and to help you to be the best that you can be, too.

 By applying what i had learned about Accelerated Learning, Psychology, Biomechanics, Music Theory, Graphic Design, Semiotics, Languages, Business Systems (I was a management consultant), Personal Coaching, Hypnosis, Marketing and Branding, Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and even magic to guitar teaching, I aim to show you just how easy, simple and logical the guitar actually is.

 You see, the guitar is easy to play - yet it is generally taught in a way that obscures it's simplicity. My stripped-down-to-the-bone approach allows beginners to progress quickly, intermediates to blossom, and experienced players to understand precisely what it is that they have been doing for years!

 So, bring your guitar and an open mind - that's all you need to get inside the music, play it like it is in your head, and for it all to make perfect sense. Chords lose their mystery, soloing stops being hysterical, modes stop meandering and improvisation is a breeze.

 Too good to be true? I didn't want it to be this easy, either; believe me, after twenty-plus years of frustration, it was a revelation for me to "get it" in a way that was transparent, simple, intelligent and quick. Pity it took me so long to see through the mystique and bullshit!

 LET'S PLAY!

 Lessons are conducted near Broseley, Shropshire, and are one-on-one. I aim to teach the music that you love, whilst giving you what seem like insider secrets that only the pros and serious session players know. Play like your guitar hero, because they are NOT superhumans with mutant hands and extraterrestrial powers. If they can do it, you can too; just learn what the serious players know, get the system, and stop wasting your precious time.
