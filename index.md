I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for 14 years. That's over 35,000 lessons! 

You'll learn what the guitar really is, with straight talk, without the nonsense and self-promoting hype. 

You see, I focus completely on teaching - it's both my full-time job and my life's love. I'm not going to  to tell you how great a player I am, who I sound like, and other irrelevant stuff. 
My goal wasn't to become a great player - it was to become an exceptional teacher, a very different path. 

Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals. Whether you want to learn guitar or bass simply for the fun of it, or you want to know how it is that some players make it look effortless while you're trying hard and getting nowhere - I can help. 

Give me a call and I'll be happy to talk you. Text me and I'll call you back - it's easier than ping-ponging texts around.
