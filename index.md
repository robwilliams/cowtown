<p> <h4><strong><em> "...a long time ago, a young boy sneaked a peek into an old guitar case, and he fell in love for the first time..."</em></strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
That's how it began for me, nearly forty years ago. I still remember the frustration, the sore fingers, and the lack of any kind of sensible explanation of the instrument. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Just like most students and players do,  I thought that was just the way it was, and if it was tough, then I was the problem - that there was something in me that was lacking.</p> 
<p></p>
<p>I stuck with it for years, until I finally hit rock-bottom and decided to quit the usual path I was on and start over from zero. That turned out to be best thing that ever happened to me, because I began to search outside of the world of music and guitar for better answers to the problem of learning to play guitar. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The real problem is that we've all been lied to and suckered-in to a way of thinking that virtually guarantees we'll have a tough time learning to play. Even before we begin, most of us are doomed to accept difficulty and frustration, even though there is no reason to suffer. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>That lie is like an ancient curse laid upon us by the gods of antiquity, and I've been setting players free from that curse ever since I had a moment of clarity and insight that set me free from the curse. </p>
<p>Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals.</p>
<p>

   I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for more than <strong>16 years</strong>. That's getting on for <strong>40,000 hours</strong> (Yes, you read it right - Forty Thousand hours) of guitar lessons and teaching experience as part of Shropshire Music Service, as a freelance peripatetic tutor and as a private tutor.

   Whilst studying for my Music Diploma I developed a teaching system that uses and improves on the traditional methods which I had been using for 23 years, and it accelerated progress for students at every level. I had no choice but to create it, because I couldn't find what I needed anywhere - not in any of the hundreds of books, videos, magazines, or on the internet. What I developed has changed the lives of guitarists for over sixteen years, now, and it can change your life too.</p>
<p>
<p></p>
</p>
<p><h4><em><strong><font color="red">"... guitar tuition with you has been fantastic... You’ve really enabled me to succeed in playing songs I never, ever thought I’d be capable of playing." </font></strong></em>  John Cooper.</h4>
</p>


<p>
     I know that you'll want to deal with reality, and with principles that will remain true for all of your guitar-playing life - so that's what I will show you, all the way. From wherever you are - right now - to wherever you want to get to. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>   
   And if you want to shake off the delusion of difficulty (who is daft enough to want <em>that?</em>) you're in the right place. 
 </p>
 <p>   </p>
<p> 
  When we work together, you'll discover what the guitar really is - with straight talk. 
  </p>
  <p>   </p>
<p>I don't peddle  nonsense, or settle into dogmatically teaching conventional wisdom. I decline to be Cool or use self-promoting hype, or spout the conventional delusions of "Cool", "mojo" or "genius" to the people I help. What I do is give you a unique system that lays bare the way music works on the guitar.
</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>
  Teaching guitar, music and creativity is both my full-time job and my life's love - and I do it all day, every day, with great people. How cool is that?
</p>
<p>   </p>

<p>  </p>
<p>   </p>
 
  I have both a First Class BA Honours degree in Music & Creative Writing and a Diploma in Music, so you can be certain that you're getting the real deal from a qualified professional. I'm also a certified Life Coach and a NLP Practitioner, so you can be sure of a flexible and sympathetic approach.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
I am also fully DBS and CRB checked and cleared, so you have complete peace of mind.
