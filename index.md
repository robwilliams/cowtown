I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for 16 years. That's over 25,00 hours of guitar lessons and teaching experience, coupled to extensive research into how the instrument works with the player's biomechanics to make it the World's favourite instrument. 

When you learn guitar with me, you'll discover what the guitar really is - with straight talk. I don't peddle  nonsense and self-promoting hype, or spout the conventional delusions of "mojo" or "genius". What I do is give you a unique system that lays bare the way music works on the guitar.

Teaching guitar, music and creativity is both my full-time job and my life's love - and I do it all day, every day, with great people. 

My goal was to  create a teaching scheme that would improved on traditional methods and accelerated progress for students at every level, letting them understand, not just "monkey-see, monkey-do" teaching. 

I have both a First Class Honours degree in Music & Creative Writing and a Diploma in Music, so you can be certain that you're getting the real deal from a qualified professional.

I am also fully DBS and CRB checked and cleared, so you can put your mind at ease.

Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals. Whether you want to learn guitar or bass simply for the fun of it, or you want to know how it is that some players make it look effortless while you're trying hard and getting nowhere - I can help. 

Give me a call and I'll be happy to talk with you, or text me and I'll call you back.
