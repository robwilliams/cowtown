<p> <strong><em> "...a long time ago, a young boy sneaked a peek into an old guitar case, and he fell in love for the first time..."</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
That's how it began for me, nearly forty years ago. I still remember the frustration, the sore fingers, and the lack of any kind of sensible explanation of the instrument. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Just like most students and players do,  I thought that was just the way it was, and if it was tough, then I was the problem - that there was something in me that was lacking.</p> 
<p></p>
<p>I stuck with it for years, until I finally hit rock-bottom and decided to quit the usual path I was on and start over from zero. That turned out to be best thing that ever happened to me, because I began to search outside of the world of music and guitar for better answers to the problem of learning to play guitar. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The real problem is that we've all been lied to and suckered-in to a way of thinking that virtually guarantees we'll have a tough time learning to play. Even before we begin, most of us are doomed to accept difficulty and frustration, even though there is no reason to suffer. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>That lie is like an ancient curse laid upon us by the gods of antiquity, and I've been setting players free from that curse ever since I had a moment of clarity and insight that set me free from the curse. </p>
<p></p>
<p>

   I've been teaching guitar In Broseley, near Telford, Shropshire for more than <strong>16 years</strong>. That's over <strong>34,000 hours</strong> (Yes, you read it right - Thirty-Four Thousand hours) of guitar lessons and teaching experience as part of Shropshire Music Service, as a freelance peripatetic tutor and as a private tutor.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>   
   Whilst studying for my Music Diploma I developed a teaching system that uses and improves on the traditional methods which I had been using for 23 years, and it accelerated progress for students at every level. I had no choice but to create it, because I couldn't find what I needed anywhere - not in any of the hundreds of books, videos, magazines, or on the internet. What I developed has changed the lives of guitarists for over sixteen years, now, and it can change your life too.</p>
<p>
<p></p>
</p>
<p><h4><em><strong><font color="red">"... guitar tuition with you has been fantastic... You’ve really enabled me to succeed in playing songs I never, ever thought I’d be capable of playing." </font></strong></em>  John Cooper.</h4>
</p>


<p>
     I know that you'll want to deal with reality, and with principles that will remain true for all of your guitar-playing life - so that's what I will show you, all the way. From wherever you are - right now - to wherever you want to get to. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>   
   And if you want to shake off the delusion of difficulty (who is daft enough to want <em>that?</em>) you're in the right place. 
 </p>
 <p></p>
<p> 
  When we work together, you'll discover what the guitar really is - with straight talk. 
  </p>
  <p></p>
<p>I don't peddle  nonsense, or settle into dogmatically teaching conventional wisdom. I decline to be Cool or use self-promoting hype, or spout the conventional delusions of "Cool", "mojo" or "genius" to the people I help. What I do is give you a unique system that lays bare the way music works on the guitar.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  Teaching guitar, music and creativity is both my full-time job and my life's love - and I do it all day, every day, with great people. How cool is that?
</p>
<p></p>
<h5><p>   
   Ask yourself these simple questions: 
   <ul>
   <li>Do you want to find out how to play every song, in every key, in every style?</li>
   <li>Do you want to find out a faster way to learn to play?</li>
   <li>Do you want to play with ease and comfort?</li>
   <li>Do you want to learn to play better, in less time than everyone else?</li>
   <li>Do you want to understand what you do?</li>
   <li>Do you want to play without limits and liberate your mind?</li>
   <li>Do you want an uncommon learning experience, rather than "monkey-see, monkey-do" teaching?</li>
   
   </ul>
   </p></h5>
<p>
<p></p>
 
  I have both a First Class BA Honours degree in Music & Creative Writing and a Diploma in Music, so you can be certain that you're getting the real deal from a qualified professional. I'm also a certified Life Coach and a NLP Practitioner, so you can be sure of a flexible and sympathetic approach.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
I am also fully DBS and CRB checked and cleared, so you have complete peace of mind.

Guitar lessons should be fun, interesting, and take you forward towards your goals. Whether you want to learn guitar or bass just for the fun of it, or you want to know how it is that some players make it look effortless while you're trying hard and getting nowhere - I can help.
