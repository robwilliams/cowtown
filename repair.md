<p><h3><strong>"This guy did a better setup on my Les Paul than the Gibson Custom Shop! Highly recommended, excellent aftercare too."</strong> - <u>Rob Hedison</u> of <a href="http://www.steel-monkey.com/index.html">Steel Monkey.</a></h3></p>

<h4><p>In life, it really matters that things work properly - imagine if your internet connection stopped working, or your phone, car or your guitar...!</p></h4>

<p>You already know how a car splutters and judders when there's something wrong with the engine, don't you?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that guitars are like that, too. </p>
<br>

<p>With a little expert attention you can get seriously improved playability, intonation and smoothness - bringing your music to life with more control, ease and vastly improved tone.</p>
<br>

Proper setting-up is the most cost-effective way to make your guitar play, sound, and feel like a much more expensive instrument. </h3></font>
</p>

<br>
<p>In fact - until you play a professionally set up guitar, you'll never know how easy it really is to play guitar.</p>
<p>Isn't it time you found out the difference that makes <i>all</i> the difference?

<p><h3><strong>"Hi Neil - feels great to play my Telecaster, now - it's like playing <i>your</i> Telecaster."</strong> - <u>Paul Leishman.</u></h3></p>
<br>
<p>
<h3><font color="green">It's a sad fact that factory guitar setups are usually a mass-production compromise, so almost any guitar can be hugely improved in its playability and feel by being properly setup. </font></h3>

Even your old Guitar can be brought back to life and give you years more service for way less than you'd lose by trading it in for another guitar. </p>

From small tweaks to the dreaded dropped guitar, the good news is that it probably isn't terminal. Even broken necks can be repaired as good as new without costing you a fortune. 
Fretwork, body damage, electrics - in fact, almost anything is do-able.</p>
<br>
<p><h2><strong>"The Les Paul is very well..Clearly, when you set a guitar up, it stays set up. Many Thanks...Best setup I've ever had - and I've had a fair few!"</strong> - <u>Rob Hedison,</u> guitarist with <a href="http://www.steel-monkey.com/index.html">Steel Monkey.</a>.</h2>

<p><h2><strong>"I bought a new guitar that needed setting . A friend of mine recommended Neil so I went to see him... I dropped my guitar off - a text later that evening informed me it was done. I am delighted with the result: much lower action, easier to play. Oh yeah - it sounds great as well. Thanks Neil"</strong> - <u>Richard Whitehead.</u></h2>
