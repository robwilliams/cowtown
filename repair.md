title: Guitar Technician / Repair Service
---

Everyone knows how an engine runs when it is tuned to perfection, and guitars are just the same: a little expert attention can seriously improve tone and playability. 

In fact - until you have played a properly set up guitar, you'll never know how easy to play the instrument is!

It's a sad fact that factory guitar setups are usually a mass-production compromise, so almost any guitar can be hugely improved in its playability and feel by being properly setup. 

Proper setting-up is the most cost-effective way to make your guitar play, sound, and feel like a much more expensive instrument. 

A professional setup is a small investment that can make >em>your</em> guitar play like a guitar costing hundreds of pounds more.

Even your old Guitar can be brought back to life and give you years more service for way less than you'd lose by trading it in for another guitar. 

Dropped your guitar? It might not be terminal. Even broken necks can be repaired as good as new without costing you a fortune. Fretwork, body damage, electrics - in fact, almost anything is do-able.
