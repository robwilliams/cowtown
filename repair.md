title: Guitar Repair
---

Until you have played a properly set up guitar, you'll never know how easy to play the instrument is. Factory setups are usually a mass-production compromise, so almost any factory-made guitar can be hugely improved in its playability and feel by being properly setup. Proper setting-up is the most cost-effective way to make your guitar play, sound, and feel like a much more expensive instrument. Setups start from around Â£20, and can make your guitar play like a guitar costing hundreds of pounds more.

Your old Guitar can be brought back to life and give you years of service for way less than trading it in for another guitar. Dropped your guitar? It might not be terminal. Even broken necks can be repaired as good as new without costing you a fortune. Fretwork, body damage, electrics - in fact, almost anything is do-able.
