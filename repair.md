 <p><h4><u><font color="blue">Special Notice:</font> We're now into week 4 without internet, and still waiting for the clowns at BT and EE to stop finger-pointing and fix it,  so email response may be slower than usual.</u></p>
    <p>Thank You.</h4></p>
    <p><h2>   </h2>    </p>


<h5><p>In life, it really matters that things work properly - like my internet connection, for instance!</p></h5>
<p>You already know how a car splutters and judders when there's something wrong with the engine, don't you?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that guitars are like that, too. With a little expert attention you can get seriously improved playability, intonation and smoothness - bringing your music to life with more control, ease and vastly improved tone.</p>
<p>But don't take my word for it - read my customers' comments, right here, or checkout my reviews on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NeilCowmeadowGuitar?ref=hl">FaceBook</a> (they're all 5-Stars!).
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"Nice job on the Martin, Neil - it plays like a dream, thanks!"</strong> - <u>Paul Sikory.</u></h4>

Proper setting-up is the most cost-effective way to make your guitar play, sound, and feel like a much more expensive instrument. </h3></font>
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"This guy did a better setup on my Les Paul than the Gibson Custom Shop! Highly recommended, excellent aftercare too."</strong> - <u>Rob Hedison</u> of <a href="http://www.steel-monkey.com/index.html">Steel Monkey.</a></h4></p>
<p>In fact - unless you have played a professionally set up guitar, you'll never know how easy to play a guitar can really be.
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"Hi Neil - feels great to play my Telecaster, now - it's like playing <i>your</i> Telecaster."</strong> - <u>Paul Leishman.</u></h4></p>
<p>
It's a sad fact that factory guitar setups are usually a mass-production compromise, so almost any guitar can be hugely improved in its playability and feel by being properly setup. 
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"Every time I bring you one of my guitars, you turn it into something special"</strong> - <u>Derek Ridgeway.</u></h4>
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color="blue">A professional setup is a small investment that can make <em>your</em> guitar play more easily and sound better, too.</font></h3>
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"Another transformation - Brilliant!"</strong> - <u>Richard Crossman.</u></h4></p>
<p>
Even your old Guitar can be brought back to life and give you years more service for way less than you'd lose by trading it in for another guitar. </p>
<p><h4><strong>"P.S. The guitar's Brilliant."</strong> - <u>Brian Gardner.</u></h4>
</p>
<p>
From small tweaks to the dreaded dropped guitar, the good news is that it probably isn't terminal. Even broken necks can be repaired as good as new without costing you a fortune. 
Fretwork, body damage, electrics - in fact, almost anything is do-able.</p>

<p><h4><strong>"The Les Paul is very well..Clearly, when you set a guitar up, it stays set up. Many Thanks...Best setup I've ever had - and I've had a fair few!"</strong> - <u>Rob Hedison,</u> guitarist with <a href="http://www.steel-monkey.com/index.html">Steel Monkey.</a>.</h4>

<p>
<h3><font color="blue">Over 15 years of repair and setup experience, plus my personal guarantee, mean that your guitar is in great hands.</font></h3>
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"I bought a new guitar that needed setting . A friend of mine recommended Neil so I went to see him... I dropped my guitar off - a text later that evening informed me it was done. I am delighted with the result: much lower action, easier to play. Oh yeah - it sounds great aswell. Thanks Neil"</strong> - <u>Richard Whitehead.</u></h4>
