title: Guitar Technician / Repair Service
---

You know how an engine runs when it is tuned to perfection?</p><p>
Well, guitars are just the same: a little expert attention can seriously improve tone and playability. 
</p><p>
In fact - unless you have played a professionally set up guitar, you'll never know how easy to play a guitar can really be.
</p><p>
It's a sad fact that factory guitar setups are usually a mass-production compromise, so almost any guitar can be hugely improved in its playability and feel by being properly setup. 
</p><p>
Proper setting-up is the most cost-effective way to make your guitar play, sound, and feel like a much more expensive instrument. 
</p><p>
A professional setup is a small investment that can make <em>your</em> guitar play more easily and sound better, too.
</p><p>
Even your old Guitar can be brought back to life and give you years more service for way less than you'd lose by trading it in for another guitar. 
<p>
From small tweaks to the dreaded dropped guitar, the good news is that it probably isn't terminal. Even broken necks can be repaired as good as new without costing you a fortune. 
Fretwork, body damage, electrics - in fact, almost anything is do-able.</p>
