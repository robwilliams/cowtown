You know how an engine runs when it is tuned to perfection?</font></h3></p>
<p>Well, guitars are just the same: a little expert attention can seriously improve tone and playability. 
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"Nice job on the Martin, Neil - it plays like a dream, thanks!"</strong> - Paul Sikory.</h4>

Proper setting-up is the most cost-effective way to make your guitar play, sound, and feel like a much more expensive instrument. </h3></font>
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"This guy did a better setup on my Les Paul than the Gibson Custom Shop! Highly recommended, excellent aftercare too."</strong> - Rob Hedison of <a href="http://www.steel-monkey.com/index.html">Steel Monkey.</a></h4></p>
<p>In fact - unless you have played a professionally set up guitar, you'll never know how easy to play a guitar can really be.
</p><p>
It's a sad fact that factory guitar setups are usually a mass-production compromise, so almost any guitar can be hugely improved in its playability and feel by being properly setup. 
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"Every time I bring you one of my guitars, you turn it into something special"</strong> - Derek Ridgeway.</h4>
</p>

<p>
<h3><font color="blue">A professional setup is a small investment that can make <em>your</em> guitar play more easily and sound better, too.</font></h3>
</p>
<p><h4><strong>"Another transformation - Brilliant!"</strong> - Richard Crossman.</h4></p>
<p>
Even your old Guitar can be brought back to life and give you years more service for way less than you'd lose by trading it in for another guitar. </p>
<p><h4><strong>"P.S. The guitar's Brilliant."</strong> - Brian Gardner.</h4>
</p>
<p>
From small tweaks to the dreaded dropped guitar, the good news is that it probably isn't terminal. Even broken necks can be repaired as good as new without costing you a fortune. 
Fretwork, body damage, electrics - in fact, almost anything is do-able.</p>
<p><h4><strong>"The Les Paul is very well..Clearly, when you set a guitar up, it stays set up. Many Thanks...Best setup I've ever had - and I've had a fair few!"</strong> - Rob Hedison, guitarist with <a href="http://www.steel-monkey.com/index.html">Steel Monkey.</a>.</h4>
